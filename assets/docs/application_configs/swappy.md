# Swappy Configuration

This document describes the Swappy screenshot editing tool configuration within Serein.

## Overview

The Swappy configuration (`config`) primarily defines where screenshots are saved and their naming convention.

*   **Save Directory:** All screenshots taken with Swappy are automatically saved to the `$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots` directory.
*   **Filename Format:** Saved screenshots are named using a timestamp format: `%Y%m%d-%H%M%S.png`. This ensures that each screenshot has a unique name based on the date and time it was captured (e.g., `20231027-143500.png`).

This simple configuration ensures that your screenshots are organized and easily retrievable.
