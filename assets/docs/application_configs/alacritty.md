# Alacritty Configuration

This document describes the Alacritty terminal emulator configuration within Serein.

## Overview

Key aspects include:

*   **Custom Color Scheme:** A custom color palette is defined, providing distinct normal, bright, primary, cursor, and selection colors. The primary background is set to `#1b1e25` and the foreground to `#eeedee`.
*   **Font:** The terminal uses `JetBrains Mono Nerd Font` with a `SemiBold` style and a size of `13.0` for clear readability.
*   **Default Shell:** Alacritty is configured to launch the `fish` shell by default, executed via `bash -c fish`.
*   **Window Settings:** The terminal window has full decorations, a slight transparency with `0.8` opacity, and generous internal padding of `15` pixels on both the x and y axes for a more spacious look.
