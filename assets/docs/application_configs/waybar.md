### `style.css` (Visual Styling)

This file defines the visual appearance of both Waybar instances, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look.

*   **Font:** Uses `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` with bold weight and `13px` font size.
*   **Window Styling:** Both Waybar instances have a dark background (`#1b1e25`) and `7px` border-radius.
*   **Tooltip Styling:** Tooltips feature a dark background, rounded corners, and blue text (`#86afef`).
*   **Workspaces & Taskbar:** Custom styling for buttons, including active, persistent, and hover states with animations and transitions.
*   **Module Styling:** A consistent style is applied to most modules, including colors (`#86afef`), background (`#242830`), opacity, margins, and padding. Specific modules like `custom-logo` have distinct styling for visual emphasis.
*   **Rounded Corners:** `custom-r_end` and `custom-l_end` modules have rounded corners to create a segmented, visually appealing look for the bar sections.
